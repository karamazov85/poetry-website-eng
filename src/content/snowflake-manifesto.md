We don’t mind the insult  
But get the order right

So first call us

the serial-apprenticeship generation  
the no-healthcare generation  
the no-state-pension generation  
the no-state-childcare generation  
the steamrolled-with-student-debt generation  
the forever-rent generation  
the forever-work generation  
the won’t-own-shit generation  
the crisis-to-crisis generation  
the banking-bailout generation  
the pandemic-job-hunters’ generation  
the good-luck-cleaning-up-in-2050 generation  
the sorry suckers’ generation

and only then, dear cornflakes,  
dear baby- and property boomers,  
<em>then</em> you may call us

the snowflake generation.
