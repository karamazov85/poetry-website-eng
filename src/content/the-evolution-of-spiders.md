One fly-infested day on Pangea  
Opening its many blinking eyes  
A spider hatched the idea  
of a web for catching flies.

After endless trying and erring  
on design, he died of hunger  
But his offspring kept on weaving  
For a hundred years and longer.

Slightly better webs, still useless,  
somehow kept on coming,  
Fly upon fly, some incremental success  
kept their start-up going.

After 500 failing generations  
of stubborn evolutionary will,  
They finished their iterations,  
All surviving still.

I’m no creationist by nature  
But the idea of a spider or two  
Instantly, as any smart creature,  
Thinking and pushing it through,

Acing a web with a good return  
To show their kids it’s worth it,  
Makes more sense at any turn  
Than the evolutionary bullshit.
