They say words are intangible  
conceptual, evanescent.

I disagree.

Words are construction material.  
They are bricks.

Some build hunting lodges  
The lesser-read may strive for a hut.

Myself, I’m building a palace  
With softly echoing walls

Through which the noise of the world  
shall reach my chamber as song.
