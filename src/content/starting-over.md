I’m not used to being  
given things for free  
Presents and luck tend  
to ring alarms in me.

And so I keep upending  
Hitting <em>delete</em> and <em>reset</em>  
on anything that’s getting  
too easy, cosy and set.

Maybe because all summits  
become plateaus over time,  
And arriving feels like giving up  
Or running out of line.
