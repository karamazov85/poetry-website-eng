It’s awesome  
how much pain  
can simply be exhaled

along with any spectre  
of You being the centre  
of this universe.

And because you care  
less about a thing  
if you’re no longer  
at the centre of it,

You can start living  
and stop worrying  
about <em>not living</em>  
and all the other shit.
