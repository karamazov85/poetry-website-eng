I was mobbed by a pack of Arab girls  
at Hatshepsut’s palace at high noon.  
Before I could blink, they formed a queue  
<em>for selfies with the Vampire</em>, they said.

In clueless awe, with gobsmacked gallantry  
I played my role as statue, character of fiction  
And answered questions – <em>No, I’m afraid, we  
vampires are not of the Muslim persuasion</em>

While basking in my minutes of faux-fame  
I pictured Hatshepsut standing where we stood  
A palace procession of Pharaoh and Queen  
marching on the shifting sands of worship.
