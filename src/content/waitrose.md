<em>\*to my favourite upmarket grocery store</em>

I wanted to be the barcode  
that beeps you into place  
Your <em>madelaine chez Swann</em>  
that makes memories shine  
My balanced, fruity notes  
were aching for your palate  
My somewhat nutty resentments  
hid well below the crust;  
I wanted to be the Earl in the Grey  
at teatime that you always spend alone  
To season your days with earthy wisdom  
and linger in your home;  
I would fair-trade my well-aged charm  
for the lesser goods’ you so fatefully picked  
And spare you all the heartbreak and harm  
you can less and less afford  
Although I harbour (who doesn’t?)  
allergens of some sort.

Days into months, months into years  
I wait forlorn in <em>Waitrose Arcadia</em>  
Hoping to be (one day, one day!)  
The unexpected item in your bagging area.
