It’s usually in Season Three  
That a series becomes <em>The Slope</em>.  
Busted killer ain’t the real deal  
Superkiller’s still at large  
<em>His</em> MO is much-much sicker  
<em>His</em> chainsaw is much-much bigger  
Lone detective’s life still sucks  
You bet it will even more  
But the plot now smells like beer  
you’ve drunk and flushed before  
Millennial dudes appear  
(Cop’s daughter is now sixteen  
she befriends the killer’s son  
to make out and get in a ton  
of shit of <em>no</em> significance)  
Every other scene it seems  
has flashes of the suspect’s dreams  
of absurd childhood trauma  
by punk-ass, rotten, wretched dad  
Killer’s jacking off in shed  
with victim’s bloody finger-puppets  
smiling from his nightstand  
While AA-skipping cop is sneaking  
through the fog in Iceland  
(or Finland? Cleveland? Ealing?)  
Can’t be arsed to ask for backup  
however long he’s been suspended  
however loud they <em>let’s-saddle-up</em>  
(He knows the other cops are crooks,  
save the rookie girl who found  
that Jane Doe in the woods)

Loved you to bits Season One  
I put up with you Season Two  
Season Three, I’ll kill you. And then  
I’ll binge on <em>Breaking Bad</em> again.
