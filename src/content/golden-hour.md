With backs against a sinking sun  
they sat, the lads and the lasses  
Boozing outside Trinity College  
After evening classes.

It took them minutes to notice  
my gaze, fixed upon their bright  
faces, the amber of their ales and  
their hair floating in golden light.

It’s not you guys, relax, it’s not you  
who’s feeding my persistence –  
It’s the backlit halo that crowns you  
In this golden hour of existence.
