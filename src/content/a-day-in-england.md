An award-winning postal worker  
went to shop â€“ but not to any shop  
An award-winning pencil retailer  
selling award-winning stock.  
He picked up his prize-winning pet  
at the award-winning pet hotel  
and picked award-winning dog shit  
on the way to his award-winning hovel  
in a multi-award-winning development  
next to the acclaimed motorway  
Then watched award-winning adult content  
on his freshly-awarded holiday.

One million new awards were given away  
elsewhere in England, that jolly dandy day.
