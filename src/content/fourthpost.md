Without overthinking  
let’s just understand

the overeducated underachievers  
who overpopulate the land

the underreported takeover  
by the overconfident

the understated, as undercut  
by the overwhelming, the hype,

the filters that overexpose  
what underwhelms otherwise

the bleak undercurrents that undermine  
the upbeat overtones.

Without overreacting  
let’s just underscore:

under-liked, I keep watching  
over lives that you call lives

and refuse to go under  
till all this over/under

is over.
