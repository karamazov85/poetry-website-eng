The bullshit job that you do  
Will do the trick for a while  
But the more you’ve done  
The more you <em>are</em> done  
it’s like doing time

except you can <em>never</em> do  
justice to your potential  
Don’t you see the trap?

done the degree  
done the career  
done the <em>coast-to-coast</em>

Yet, you’re never done wanting to do  
<em>more</em> so that you may live up to  
that something that you boast.

I’ve set out to sit this out  
And not let my doings do me in  
I find release in what I <em>could</em> do  
without actually doin’.

This bullshit reasoning, I hope  
will do the trick for a while.
