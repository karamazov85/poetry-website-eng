Two monstrous black holes  
Crashed into each other today.

That is, a billion years, a billion miles away  
But the waves hit Earth only yesterday.

Galaxy-sized and blacker than black  
They jolted the Universe forth and back

A trillion nukes dropped to nullify  
a trillion planets of the star-spangled sky.

As the cataclysmic shockwaves landed  
I woke in tears and sweaty-handed

I knew, I felt that something was on  
And passing, it shook me to the bone.

Not the black holes – I knew zilch about that  
I heard it on the news at the laundromat.

No. It was my landlord’s letter –  
That pay my fucking rent I’d better.
