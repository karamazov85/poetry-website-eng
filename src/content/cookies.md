To find a spare kitchen in the mind,  
a spare cupboard â€“ or a cookie jar  
for the sugar rush of sound

whirls of vowels caking into rhyme  
rhythm to toss them in and out of time  
drizzles of doubt to rain onto it all

a nook for nuggets  
a crevice for crumbs  
a cranny for the cookies

to feed inside that something  
that all the worldly yummies  
leave forever wanting
