Dashing through Paris to the airport, you and I,  
like <em>Jules et Jim</em> and the third guy on the bridge  
– that’s where you first lost a wheel.

You toughed it out since, daring the world’s high  
curbs, cobblestones, the odd rocky ridge  
– a plastic shell with a heart made of steel.

In Newark, a U.S. Customs officer  
snapped your fragile zip-lock dead in anger,  
– despite your birthmark, the TSA-keyhole.

I didn’t take United’s replacement offer.  
Without you, I could carry on no longer  
– my own shell a shambles, my load ever so sore.

What do they call this in your language, Dear?  
This <em>hard-shell resolve</em>, this <em>stiff upper zip</em>?  
Whatever it is, you are a textbook case.

Every loss has brought us closer still.  
So let’s keep going, you and I, let’s slip  
on a flight now – I know you love the chase.
