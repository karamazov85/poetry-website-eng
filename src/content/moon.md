My moon is at her apogee  
The farthest she can get from me  
Is it something that I said?  
A silent friction that we had?

Look how quickly her smile fades  
How steadily she now rotates  
to turn her mild, celestial face  
to empty wall, to empty space

Little Moon, my Little Moon  
Come back to rise in my lagoon  
My howling wolves are all on fire  
My tidal patterns go haywire

Luckily, moons can be bribed  
after they have sulked and cried  
Gifts, kisses, massage â€“ and then  
the masses may converge again

Just remember: love is the Force  
that draws gravitational course  
My moon is back, at perigee  
As close as she can get to me
