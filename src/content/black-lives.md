The first black person I ever met  
became a friend in five minutes.  
We were fifteen, in a full-white country  
where blacks are still called <em>néger</em>,  
Maybe because there are no blacks  
to take offence – almost none, that is.

I found perverse pleasure in being  
stared at on the bus while speaking <em>foreign</em>,  
A little girl behind us asked what  
that language was, her father said  
<em>English, the tongue of Livingstone</em>  
Which was either a jab or just the awe  
at the exotic, at <em>the African</em>.

Mother Ethiopian, father Jamaican,  
Jonny lived close by in our street,  
Six kids with American textbooks,  
musical instruments, coveted video games,  
quixotic names and very curly hair.  
The girls were too young to be called beautiful  
but I was tempted to think so nonetheless,  
And I found Jesus oddly queer and cool  
in their Bible cartoons which were plentiful.

A decade later, I was knocking around  
In Johannesburg and Soweto,  
The parts you’re not supposed to go,  
At dusk, when you’re not supposed to go  
<em>You are so white, you’re not supposed to go</em>  
And now I understood Jonny’s bus rides  
in all-white country, all those years ago.

Kids approached, with fathers twice my size  
I feared that Livingstone would come up  
with a whole different edge altogether  
But no, the kids would just stroke the hair  
on my calves, my head and my face,  
giggling like I’d come from outer space  
and their dads were asking stuff about  
the English Premier League.

And I thought  
<em>black lives, white lives</em>, all this bullshit  
colour-coding of human beings  
will one day be shrouded in the past  
Or stared at, clinically psychoanalyzed  
Like something that only the sick  
dreamed possible.
